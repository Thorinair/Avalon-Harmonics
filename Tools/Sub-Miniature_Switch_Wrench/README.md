# Avalon Harmonics Sub-Miniature Switch Wrench

**Tool for tightening Sub-Miniature Switch nuts**

Sub-Miniature Switch Wrench is a 3D printable tool designed to help tighten nuts on Sub-Miniature Switches. Using this plastic tool ensures that you cannot scratch your beautiful front panel, as well as making the whole tightening process much simpler and faster.

**NOTE: The tool should last a long time, but I am unable to guarantee that it will last forever. Make sure not to overtighten to prolong the lifetime!**
