# Avalon Harmonics WF

**WaveFolder with DC offset controls and offset CV**

WF is Avalon Harmonics' first module ever.

The module offers simple 2-stage wave folding in a compact format, which allows it to easily be mounted next to an existing VCO to augment it. The volume of the input can be attenuated and an additional offset CV can be fed and attenuated which can either be used as a way of modulating the DC offset or as an additional waveform mixed with the input signal. A static DC offset can also be added using the third knob.

Additionally, the module has two trimmers on the PCB which allows for adjustment to the wave shaping. These can be used to tune an irregular shape or to compensate for assymetric power supply of the rack.
