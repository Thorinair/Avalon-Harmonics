# Avalon Harmonics kNOT

**Triple logic NOT gate**

kNOT provides three logic NOT gates. A low value (0V) on input will result in a high value (+5V) on output, and vice versa, allowing the module to be used to invert gate signals. The gates are also chained together (1 to 2 and 2 to 3) unless a cable is inserted in one of the input jacks. This automatically breaks the connection and the gate becomes independent.

The gates can also be driven at audio rates, allowing them to be used as a "digitalizer" for a noise source (great for making vinyl-like crackle), or any other audio source (feeding it a triangle and offsetting it will create a PWM effect). Additionally, The output of the third gate can be routed through a slew limiter (like Avalon Harmonics R&F) back to the input of the first gate in order to create a highly chaotic, but customizable noise souce, which can be sampled from the output of the second gate.

The gates are polarity protected and will also not get damaged by any eurorack voltage levels. Anything above around +1V is considered as high on the input, and will result in a low (0V) output.

Each of the three gates also have a status LED which signifies whether the output is high or low. When high, the output is at +5V.
