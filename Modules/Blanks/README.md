# Avalon Harmonics Blank Panels

This folder contains 3D printable files for Avalon Harmonics branded blank plates. When preparing for print, make sure to rotate them over so they are facing down. The panels are meant to be printed with two different colors of filament. The color should be swapped after the 2nd layer when printing at 0.2mm layer thickness.

The STL file names are formatted like this: `Eurorack_Blanks__[hp size]_[logo].stl`
