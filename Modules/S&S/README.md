# Avalon Harmonics S&S

**S&H with built in random, slew limiter and noise source**

S&S is a complex module which offers multiple features in a tight 3hp package.

In its core, it is a sample & hold module with standard input and trigger jacks. The input that can be sampled can range from around 9.5V to -4.5V. Note that if the value is outside this range, it will be clipped but won't damage the module.

It can also perform sampling from a built in random source. This allows it to be used as a randomizer. The random source generally generates values between -2.5V and +2.5V, but randomly peaks outside this range as well. Source of the sampled values can be chosen with the top-most switch.

Sampling speed can go all the way into high audio rates, allowing the module to be used as a sort of sample crusher effect. For slower sample rates, the held value can be slew limited by engaging the second switch. After enabling, the knob controls the slew time, from very short to quite long. This can be useful to smooth out the output and serve as a continuous random CV modulator.

The module also has an extra white noise output jack. This noise is internally used for the S&H random source, but may also be used here for drum synthesis or such.

Lastly a bipolar LED shows the status of the output of the module.
