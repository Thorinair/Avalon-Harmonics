# Avalon Harmonics CVMod8

**8 channel CV attenuator and offset**

The module provides 8 channels of independent CV attenuation and offset controls.

Each channel can be used as a static slider controlled voltage source. The output voltage can be bipolar (-5V to +5V)  or unipolar (0V to +6.67V) by adjusting jumpers on the back of the PCB. This can be adjusted for each channel individually.

Each channel also has a signal input with a corresponding attenuation knob. This means that a CV signal can be fed into the channel and then attenuated and offset using the slider. The output is available in the top most jacks.

A bipolar LED exists for each channel as a clear indicator of the status of the output voltage.

Additionally, each channel can forward its output to the next channel by placing jumpers on the back of the PCB. This allows the module to be configured for use as a sort of CV or signal mixer.
