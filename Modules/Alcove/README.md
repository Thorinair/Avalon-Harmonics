# Avalon Harmonics Alcove

**Blank for storing manuals**

Alcove is a simple "module" similar to a blank, but provides a 50mm deep slot where you can store various manuals or cheat sheets for other modules. The module is only 1 HP in width, so it can be fitted where there is a small gap in your rack.

The module is fully 3D printed as one piece and, just like a blank, features no electronics.
