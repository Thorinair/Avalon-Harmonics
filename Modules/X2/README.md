# Avalon Harmonics X2

**4 channel voltage doubler**

**NOTE: The power connector of this module will most likely touch the bottom rail of your rack. As far as I have seen, all rails follow the same standard, so this should not be a problem. Refer to the last photo to see how this looks like. This will be fixed in a future revision.**

X2 is a simple and compact module which will double the voltage level of any signal. Designed to be a perfect companion for the Avalon Harmonics CVMod8 V2 and CVMod4. **Features a golden (ENIG coated) panel.**

Some modules expect a higher voltage than 5V to trigger. This is where this module comes to bridge the gap. The module provides 4 independent channels, each providing exactly 2x gain of the input voltage. This functionality allows it to expand the voltage range of CVMod8 V2, CVMod4 or any other module that outputs up to around 5V.

Using special rail-to-rail operational amplifiers, the module can reach up to 10V on the output, provided the main rack power supply is within specs. A range of +5V to -5V will become +10V to -10V.
