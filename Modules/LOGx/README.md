# Avalon Harmonics LOGx

**Dual logic gate with swappable IC**

LOGx provides two independent logic gates. The types of gates depend on the chip inserted on the PCB, meaning the module can have AND, OR, XOR, etc. gates. The circuit accepts the standard 4000-series CMOS logic ICs.

The gates are polarity protected and will also not get damaged by any eurorack voltage levels. Anything above around +1V is considered as high on the input.

Each of the two gates also have a status LED which signifies whether the output is high or low. When high, the output is at +5V.

### Features

* Dual logic gates
* Gates can be changed by swapping the IC
* Voltage protected inputs
* Status LEDs for output
* Wrong polarity protection
* Power: +12V: 5mA, -12V: 0mA
