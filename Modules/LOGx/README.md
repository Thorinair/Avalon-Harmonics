# Avalon Harmonics LOGx

**Dual logic gate with swappable IC**

LOGx provides two independent logic gates. The types of gates depend on the chip inserted on the PCB, meaning the module can have AND, OR, XOR, etc. gates. The circuit accepts the standard 4000-series CMOS logic ICs. The module works great when driven by gate signals, allowing you to do logical operations on them. For instance, outputting a gate signal when both inputs are high (AND gate), or outputting a gate signal when only one or both inputs are high (OR gate).

The gates can also be driven at audio rates, allowing it to be used to perform operations between different audio sources and waveforms. Feeding them two different VCO signals can create various interesting and unexpected interactions in sound, usually sounding quite low-fi due to the square output.

The gates are polarity protected and will also not get damaged by any eurorack voltage levels. Anything above around +1V is considered as high on the input.

Each of the two gates also have a status LED which signifies whether the output is high or low. When high, the output is at +5V.
