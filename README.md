This repository provides a collection of modular synthesizer modules designed by Thorinair under the brand name "Avalon Harmonics". The modules are all designed to have heavy associations with the [Avali](https://avali.fandom.com/wiki/The_Official_Avali_Wiki) fictional species and to have some unique functionalities - mostly stuff that I needed but couldn't readily find elsewhere.
